      <h2>Fake Degrees Quite Common In Malaysia, <br>Even High Up The Chain</h2>
      <hr>
      <div>
      <p>
        Malaysia said to be "one of the worst" countries when it comes
        to fake education certifications.
        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        <br><br>
        One in 20 job candidates have fake degrees and other qualifications
        while one in 10 has credentials from unaccredited institutions,
        <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/05/06/a-worrying-trend-in-msia/">according to The Star.</a>
        <br><br>
        Akhbar & Associates, a Malaysian corporate fraud investigation agency,
        revealed in 2019 that the background checks on potential new hires for
        companies found that 5% to 7% of candidates had fake degrees, while
        10% to 15% have qualifications from unaccredited universities.
        <br><br>
        Akhbar & Associates Managing Director Datuk Seri Akhbar Satar explained
        that these people were applying for Senior Management positions across
        multiple industries including banking and healthcare.
        Last year in Pakistan, the CEO of a fake degree ‘mill’ called Axact –
        which boasted a network of over 370 fake online universities based in
        the United States and 22 others – was sentenced to
        <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1418156">20 years in jail each by the courts.</a>
        From the case, Pakistani authorities also found 80 Malaysian names and addresses.
        It seems thousands of fake degree holders are working as doctors,
        nurses, teachers and engineers across Southeast Asia.
        <br><br>
        Akhbar said Malaysia was “one of the worst” nations plagued with the
        issue of fake degrees and certification because companies here didn’t
        do background checks or lodge police reports. This allows false
        qualification holders to simply face “internal action” before moving
        on to the next job.
        <br><br>
        The Malaysian Medical Council (MMC) and Institution of Engineers (IEM)
        have already taken steps to ensure that only qualified and properly
        certified doctors and Engineers can practice their respective trade in Malaysia.
        Employers are now calling for action to be taken against staff who
        secured their post with degree mill and fake qualifications.
        <br><br>
        Echoing the call for action is Malaysian Employers Federation
        executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan.However, Malaysian
        Qualifications Agency (MQA) CEO Datuk Dr Rahmah Mohamed said it is the
        organization’s responsibility to check the qualifications of their
        employees were accredited accordingly.
        <br><br>
        So, it is still upon the employer to do their due diligence and conduct
        background checks if they suspect an employee’s qualifications are fake.

      <h2>Higher Education Minister: <br>1/4 Of Fresh Grads To Struggle In job
      Hunt Following Covid-19 Impacts</h2>
      <hr>
      <div>
      <p>
        Higher Education Minister Noraini Ahmad is not optimistic of fresh
        graduates’ success in job hunting within six months of graduation
        following the impact of Covid-19.
        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        <br><br>
        About 75,000 out of 300,000 fresh graduates are projected to face
        challenges in the job market as the economy struggles to find its footing.
        <br><br>
        The Higher Education Ministry also showed that 41,161 graduates still
        remained unemployed via the Graduate Tracer Study 2019. With an
        additional projected 75,000 fresh graduates this year, it is estimated
        that around 116,161 graduates will need additional help to further
        increase their marketability.
        <br><br>
        In her speech at the launch of the minister’s Career Advancement
        Programme, she noted that a job matching process for unemployed
        graduates has been implemented in collaboration with the Social
        Security Organisation (SOCSO) via the MyFutureJobs portal.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, the ministry also has multiple schemes to help graduates
        embark on a career path or entrepreneurial path. They will soon
        introduce a micro-financing scheme for students to grow and improve
        their own business together with the National Entrepreneur Group
        Economic Fund (Tekun Nasional).
        <br><br>
        The Graduates Reference Hub for Employment and Training (GREaT) will
        offer services such as job matching, reskilling, and upskilling
        programmes, as well as grants for further education and career counselling.
        <br><br>
        This career advancement programme is limited time only, and will run
        from October 16 to Decemeber 31 at 20 selected public universities,
        polytechnics, and community colleges. Job placements for participants
        of the programme will begin on January 1 2021.

      <h2>HR Deputy Minister Says M'sian<br>Graduates' Lack of Soft Skills &amp;
      Selective Nature Reasons<br>Why They Fail To Secure Jobs</h2>
      <hr>
      <div>
      <p>
        The number of unemployed grads have been rising steadily since 2016.
        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        <br><br>
        Human Resource Deputy Minister Awang Hashim has said that the reasons
        why Malaysian graduates fail to secure jobs was because of their
        selective nature and lack of soft skills. He added that besides that,
        another reason was their failure to obtain information on job
        vacancies that suited their qualifications.
        <br><br>
        "Low qualifications or CGPA also caused employers to be less interested
        to hire these candidates, besides the mismatch between the candidates’
        field of study and the job market." Awang Hashim via Malay Mail
        <br><br>
        Awang made the statement during the Dewan Negara sitting today in
        response to Senator Idris Ahmad’s question on the statistics and data
        from 2015 until July this year on unemployment among graduates with
        first-degree qualifications.
        <br><br>
        Based on statistical data from the 2016 Graduate Statistics Report,
        Awang said that the unemployment rate among fresh grads were at 4% in
        2016, 4% in 2017, 3.9% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019.
        <br><br>
        Although the unemployment rate seems to have hardly changed since 2016,
        the actual number of unemployed graduates has been constantly increasing.
        In 2016  there were 145,800 unemployed graduates, 154,500 in 2017, then
        161,300 in 2018, and finally 170,300 in 2019.
